## Author

## Project Description 
#### This project is meant to help the users to find the types of triangles by inputting the values of 3 sides of a triangle.
#### The answer will be printed out basing on the lengths inputtted.

## Breakdown of the project individual behaviours
#### The length sizes cannot form  a triangle i.e lengthA >= (lengthB + lengthC)
#### None of the three length sizes is equal to each other hence they form a Scalene Triangle i.e lengthA != lengthB && 
#### lengthB != lengthC
#### The 2 length sizes of a triangle are equal hence they form an Isosceles Triangle i.e lengthA == lengthB || 
#### lengthB == lengthC
#### All length sizes are equal hence they form an Equilateral Triangle i.e lengthA == lengthB && lengthB == lengthC
